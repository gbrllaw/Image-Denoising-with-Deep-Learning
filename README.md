# Image-Denoising-with-Deep-Learning
# 🖼️ Image Denoising with Deep Learning

A deep learning project that removes noise from images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  
**Goal**: Restore clean images from artificially noised versions.  
**Approach**: CNN-based autoencoder trained on noisy-clean image pairs.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `2_DL.ipynb` – Notebook containing noise addition, model training, and evaluation
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

---

## 🔍 Dataset

- **Clean Images**: Original images  
- **Noisy Images**: Generated by adding Gaussian or salt-and-pepper noise to clean images  

The model learns to map noisy images back to clean images.

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Noise Addition**  
   - Load original images  
   - Add synthetic noise (Gaussian / salt-and-pepper)  
   - Create noisy-clean pairs  

2. **Model Development**  
   - Convolutional Autoencoder  
   - Encoder compresses features, decoder reconstructs images  
   - Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE)  

3. **Training & Evaluation**  
   - Train on noisy-clean pairs  
   - Metric: SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)  

4. **Inference**  
   - Input a noisy image → Output a denoised image

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model     | SSIM    |
|-----------|--------|
| Model 1   | 0.9389 |
| Model 2   | 0.9453 |

**Analysis:**  
Model 2 outperforms Model 1 with a higher SSIM, indicating better structural similarity of the reconstructed images to the original ones, even though the difference is small (~0.0064).
